This project is meant to analyze images or rocks scraped for diatoms and determine surface area.
It takes a folder full of images with SID at the beginning and SID-D for duplicates and a ground truth files with SID and Average Foil Size (cm2) columns.
A display boolean can be toggled to display each processed result.
A csv is produced at the end with ground truth values compared to estimated values.
Standard procedure for taking photos of the rocks is as follows:
  Make sure the side of the board is in contrast with the background it is set on (ex. if cutting board is set on grass, use orange side. If cutting board is set on autumn leaves, use green side)
  Capture the whole board in the frame, being sure not to cut off any edges as they are necessary for size calculation.
  If shadows are particularly notable, use something to block out directional light (ex. an umbrella to block out the sun)
